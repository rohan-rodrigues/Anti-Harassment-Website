								<p>Internationally, studies show that between 70-99% of women (stat from Stop Street Harassment) experience street harassment at some point during their lives.</p>
								<p>Forty-eight percent of surveyed middle and high school students said they were sexually harassed at least once, typically by their peers, during the 2010-2011 school year, according to a report released Monday by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), a group that advocates for gender equality in schools.

									<p>Hearing reports about harassment in different areas in California, I feel as if I am not safe in any area. Last week, I finished working out at the gym, and as I was walking home, I kept on looking back with my flashlight, just to make sure I was safe. I really wish I would not have to worry about my own safety.</p>

									<p>“One day, as I was walking in Oakland for a concert, I walked by a group of men who were saying inappropriate things about my body. I felt very scared, and did not have anyone to help me. This application has helped increase my insecurity when I walk outside now, in neighborhoods I used to feel were not safe.”</p>
